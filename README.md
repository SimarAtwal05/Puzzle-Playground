## ðŸ§  AI Logic

### Tic Tac Toe AI Rules (priority order):
1. **Win** â€“ Take a winning move if available.  
2. **Block** â€“ Prevent the player from winning.  
3. **Take Center** â€“ Occupy the center if free.  
4. **Take Corner** â€“ Choose a corner square.  
5. **Take Side** â€“ Choose a side square.  

### Dots and Boxes AI Rules (priority order):
1. **Complete a Box** â€“ Draw a line to complete a box.  
2. **Safe Move** â€“ Draw a line that avoids giving the opponent a box.  
3. **Losing Move** â€“ If unavoidable, give a box but minimize damage.  
4. **Random Move** â€“ Choose any remaining valid line.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
